* Install `composer`
* Add `autoload` to `composer.json`
#### Spaces & SRC Files
* Create an index file to create the function that is going to be later mocked by the factories.
#### Test/Factories
* Create Factories for which will mock those functions inside of the classes or interface created.
#### Test
* Create Factory test to verify that factory is built.

#### Index.php
* Create php index file to implement php functions on a user interface.
